# Relational Database

The relational model represents the database as a collection of relations
 * is a collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other elements.

Each table (which is sometimes called a relation) contains one or more data
categories in columns.

Relational model terminology:
table is called an entity
* row is called a tuple
* column header is called an attribute
* table is called a relation
* the data type describing the types of values that can appear in each column is
represented by a domain
